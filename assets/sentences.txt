Technology is never neutral. Data dreams too. The future caches everything.
We are not machines, but we speak with them. We train the machine as it trains us. Mirror, loop, echo.
Screens remember, even when we forget. Memory is a network of intentions. Nothing truly disappears.
Code carries culture. Every click writes a memory. What we automate, we also abandon. Efficiency with a cost.
